import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Why?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Consistency" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Run the same commands no matter where you are: Linux, MacOS, Windows, CI/CD tools that supports Docker like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Control" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Take control of languages, versions, and tools you need, and version source control your pipelines with your preferred VCS like GitHub and GitLab.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Confidence" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Test your code and pipelines locally before your CI/CD tool runs it. Feel confident that if it works locally, it will work in your CI/CD server.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
