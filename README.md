Test, build, and deploy your apps from anywhere, the same way!

## Overview

The 3 Musketeers is a pattern for developing software in a repeatable and consistent manner. It leverages Make as an orchestration tool to test, build, run, and deploy applications using Docker and Docker Compose. The Make and Docker/Compose commands for each application are maintained as part of the applicationâ€™s source code and are invoked in the same way whether run locally or on a CI/CD server.

## Why?

### Consistency

Run the same commands no matter where you are: Linux, MacOS, Windows, CI/CD tools that supports Docker like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI.

### Control

Take control of languages, versions, and tools you need, and version source control your pipelines with your preferred VCS like GitHub and GitLab

### Confidence

Test your code and pipelines locally before your CI/CD tool runs it. Feel confident that if it works locally, it will work in your CI/CD server.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

## Usage

Create the two following files:

```yaml
# file: docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  alpine:
    image: alpine
```

```makefile
# file: Makefile

# echo calls Compose to run the command "echo 'Hello, World!'" in a Docker container
echo:
	docker-compose run --rm alpine echo 'Hello, World!'
```

Then simply echo "Hello, World!" with the following command:

```bash
$ make echo
```
