Test, build, and deploy your apps from anywhere, the same way!

## Overview

The 3 Musketeers is a pattern for developing software in a repeatable and consistent manner. It leverages Make as an orchestration tool to test, build, run, and deploy applications using Docker and Docker Compose. The Make and Docker/Compose commands for each application are maintained as part of the applicationâ€™s source code and are invoked in the same way whether run locally or on a CI/CD server.

## Why?

### Consistency

Run the same commands no matter where you are: Linux, MacOS, Windows, CI/CD tools that supports Docker like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI.

### Control

Take control of languages, versions, and tools you need, and version source control your pipelines with your preferred VCS like GitHub and GitLab

### Confidence

Test your code and pipelines locally before your CI/CD tool runs it. Feel confident that if it works locally, it will work in your CI/CD server.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

## Usage

Create the two following files:

```yaml
# file: docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  alpine:
    image: alpine
```

```makefile
# file: Makefile

# echo calls Compose to run the command "echo 'Hello, World!'" in a Docker container
echo:
	docker-compose run --rm alpine echo 'Hello, World!'
```

Then simply echo "Hello, World!" with the following command:

```bash
$ make echo
```

## Website

This repository is the [3musketeers.io][link3Musketeers] website built with [VitePress][linkVitePress]. This section explains how to develop, test, and deploy using the 3 Musketeers.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Development

```bash
# create a .env file
$ make envfile ENVFILE=env.example
# install dependencies
$ make deps

# start vitepress server for local development
$ make dev
# wait till the message 'vite v2.5.3 dev server running at' appears
# access the website in your browser at http://localhost:8080/
# \<ctrl-c\> to stop

# build static site
$ make build

# serve static site for local development
$ make serveDev
# access the website in your browser at http://localhost:8080/
# \<ctrl-c\> to stop

# serve static website (headless)
$ make serve

# test static website
$ make test

# deploy to netlify (do not forget to set the environment variables)
$ make deploy

# clean
$ make clean

# contributing? make sure the following command runs successfully
$ make all
```

### Deployment

The 3 Musketeers website is deployed to Netlify. This section shows how to create site, deploy, and delete using [Netlify CLI](https://cli.netlify.com/commands/). This is handy when previewing new changes.

#### Prerequisites

- A [Netlify](https://netlify.com) account
- A [personal access token](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications)

#### Create a new site

This section creates a blank Netlify site. Ensure the `.env` file contains the access token.

```bash
# All the following commands will be run inside a container
$ make shell

# Disable telemetry (optional)
$ yarn run netlify --telemetry-disable

# Create new Netlify blank site
$ yarn run netlify sites:create --disable-linking
# Answer the questions regarding the team and site name
# Site name can be something like 3musketeers-preview-{random 5 digit numbers)
Site Created

Admin URL: https://app.netlify.com/sites/site-name
URL:       https://site-name.netlify.app
Site ID:   site-id

# You can always get back that information
$ yarn run netlify sites:list

# Copy the ID to .env
```

#### Deploy

This section deploys the website to an existing netlify site. Ensure the `.env` file is contains the right site ID and access token.

```bash
# Build the website
$ make build

# Deploy to netlify
$ make deploy

# Test the website
$ curl https://site-name.netlify.app
```

#### Delete

This section deletes the netlify site. Ensure the `.env` file is contains the right site ID and access token.

```bash
# All the following commands will be run inside a container
$ make shell

# Disable telemetry (optional)
$ yarn run netlify --telemetry-disable

# Delete the site (optional)
$ yarn run netlify sites:delete

# Exit the container
$ exit
```
