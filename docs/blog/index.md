## Generate Table of Contents with GitHub Actions

A couple of years ago when a new Engineer joined amaysim it could take them a few days to set up their machine with locally running versions of our applications (before they could even start to understand how the apps worked and then start the path to becoming productive). Then, depending on the application, deploying to production was often a black art, the mastery of which was known only to a few (unfortunate) chosen souls.

Fast-forward to today and the number of applications we build and support has more than quadrupled, but every Engineer can pull down almost any application, have it up and running and the tests passing in less than 10 minutes. And then they can deploy to production.

This is the story of how the 3 Musketeers enabled this change.
